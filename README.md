# jschere.com - my personal pit of stupidity


[jschere.com](https://jschere.com) is and will continue to be the homepage for all the stupid little things I do. Right now, it hosts some random facts about me and my public key. I did all the CSS and JavaScript for this website by myself, except where other sources have been quoted. I hope to expand it even further with technologies like Three.js, but I'm gonna stick to plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for tradition's sake.
