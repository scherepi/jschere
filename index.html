            <h3 class="center">coding janky little stuff and things</h3>
            <p class="content">so how did i get into this? well, it started when i was a little kid, watching Katy Perry music videos on the iMac in our living room. even then, my parents were pretty astonished at how intuitively i navigated the computer. i loved playing all the little games i could find on websites like <a href="https://pbskids.org" target="_blank">PBS Kids</a>, and this quickly became the main thing i associated the internet with (to be expected of a kid that age).</p>
            <p class="content">i played all kinds of silly flash games and stuff on my grandma's computer with my brother, and eventually i came across the infamous <a href="https://geektyper.com" target="_blank">geektyper</a>, which of course i used to scare everyone i knew and try to convince them i was already some kind of tiny evil hackerman.</p>
            <p class="content">but fun and games can only get you by for so long; eventually i had to get my hands dirty.<br> in middle school i started learning HTML and CSS through a website i found (the glorious products of which are clearly evident before you), and i actually understood it pretty well! i learned how good it feels to create, and how well the computer can serve as a canvas.</p>
            <p class="content">then as i entered high school i started learning about the real heavy duty stuff... that's right, i picked up Python! got a 4 in ap computer science principles because i didn't pay attention at all, but sophomore year i started realizing "hey, i actually kinda like learning new things" and devoted myself to the glorious study of Java.</p>

            <h3 class="center" id="hackz">hacking and poking and smashing</h3>
            <p class="content">once i started figuring out how computers work, i also began seeing how to bend them to my will. i was in fourth grade when i opened the Chrome dev tools for the first time, and now i'm studying for my CompTIA Security+ certification.</p>
